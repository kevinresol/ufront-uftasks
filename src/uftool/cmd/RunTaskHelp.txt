usage: runtask <taskset> <taskname>

    Runs one of your admin tasks from the command line.

Optional flags can be used to define any variables needed for the task. Taskset reflects the class
name of your AdminTaskSet and taskname reflects the method name of the given task, and both can be 
given lowercase.  You don't need to include the package in "taskset" either.

If your classes have case sensitive naming, or you have different sets with the same name but in 
different packages, you can be more explicit and give the fully qualified, case-included name.

Examples
    
    # Same as calling AnimalTasks.patKitty();
    uftool runtask animaltasks patkitty

    # Same as calling AuthTasks.createUser('jason', 'mylittlepony');
    uftool runtask authtasks createuser -username=jason -password=mylittlepony

    # If you want to run a different AuthTasks, you can use the fully qualified, case
    # sensitive naming, same as calling otherpackage.AuthTasks.createUser('obama', 'imtheboss'):
    uftool runtask otherpackage.AuthTasks createUser -username=jason -password=mylittlepony
